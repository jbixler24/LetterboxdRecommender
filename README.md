# LetterboxdRecommender
Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), Factorization Machine (FM) and Deep Factorization Machine (DeepFM) models for film recommendation. All models are trained on Letterboxd review data scraped from all reviewers in their "Popular reviewers" section who have publicly accessible diaries.

All code is available in this repository and all data are available [on my Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10J0tda4H75Tz9BTFOvOXVS5kwfG_gj38?usp=drive_link). Film data is stored in `final_letterboxd_movies.json` and review data is stored in `final_letterboxd_reviews.json`. An additional 2.5 million entries consisting of the top 500 most popular reviews from most of the same reviewers are available in `letterboxd_reviews_unique`.
